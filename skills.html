  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> Hello, I'm Irem. I'm 18 years old and I was born on the 26th of June, 1997 in Konya, Turkey.
My father is dentist technician and my mother is a nurse. Also, I have a little brother 7 years old. He started to learn reading this year and very interested in English.
We get along very well together, we play games, going to cinema together and watch somethings.   </p>
  <p>I started to kindergarden when I was 3 and I liked there alot and I learned lots of things. Then, I started to primary school in Konya.
I was a always good studend in primary, middle and high school. My favorite lesson has always been English. Now, I am in Dokuz Eylul University and 
studying computer engineering. Our lessons and homeworks are hard but I am happy to be here. </p>
  <p>Life to me means friends and family who you can trust and who trusts you. I'm pretty much on the positive side of life but like everyone I do have bad and 
  good days. I have a best friend who always with me and we have known each other for over 10 years. We went to same middle and high school together and also we were neighbor.
  It's good to have a friend like her.
    </p>
	<p>I have a few hobbies and phobias like everyone. I'm interested in English like I said and always read news and magazines. I don't like sport but 
I love swimming, I have a few degrees in little competitions when I was in high school. And I like reading blogs which is about fashion, tattoos, travelling and animals.
 My biggest phobia is insects. They're like my nightmare.</p>
 <p>In conlusion, as I said in the beggining, I was born in Konya, now I'm in Ä°zmir and I've seen lots of places in Turkey but I want to see more of the Turkey.
I would love to meet with new people and learn new cultures. 
 </p>
  <p>Hope you enjoyed reading things about me! </p>
